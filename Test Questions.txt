1. Sum everything from 1 to 1,000,000 skipping every number divisible by 7 (so 7,  14, 21, etc should not be included). 

You will probably need to use an "if" statement, in conjutuncture with a for or while loop. 

2. Delete every vowel in MyText.txt and print to console

3. Write MyText.txt backwards, that is start from the right, and print the characters while going left. (backwards becomes sdrawkcab)

4. Bonus... If a word has 4 or less characters, spell it backwards, otherwise write it normally.
